## Description

Game is usually runs on DE, CS maps  (E.G.:  de_dust2). Unlike other mods, this modification doesn’t have infection mod. Thats why kill or be killed. Play as team, on this gamemod teamwork is key. Zombies gets random classes with special abilities. Humans must to level up in order to get better weapons  It is possible to get various upgrades from shop items but sacrificing your own weapon xp (typing command ul). When human dies he respawns in 30-60, so humans must to survive during that time, zombie respawns in few seconds. Classes pretty much like Left4Dead, it has tank who spawns over some time and is superior to other zombies, this is also key for zombies to win. Humans must survive until 0:00

## GunXp mod (recommended)
Humans gain xp for killing zombies, winning a round. People starts with glocks or however server is configurated and climbs on levels which makes a bit addictable server. There are ideas to expand level system even more (like reset tiers and getting rewards for it like new zombie class)

## Flags (optional)
There is optional flag mod, where you capture the flag and trying to protect it from other team

## Zombies

Zombie swarm has currently these classes:
* Boomer – Explodes after death, makes some damage also blinds nearby humans. Also has ability to Vomit enemies which makes them blinded.
* Fury (Tank) – Spawns after some time, this zombie is key to victory.
* Hunter – This zombie can make really crazy jumps
* Phantom – Possibility to make himself full invisible
* Smoker – Can drag person with his tongue. Makes smoke effect after death.

## Humans

Humans level up in order to get better weapon, get better upgrades. How do they get xp? Makes damage to zombies and gets some xp.

## Prestige

Prestige system is GunXp mod expansion. When you reach levels it's over, but Prestige mod allows users to have levels reset and get some kind of bonus and continue leveling (a.k.a. grinding for those extra bonus). There a few tiers for leveling in other words:

Levels
* When you reach certain level you get levels reset and get 1 Reborn, 1 Reborn point, +1 to total reborns.
* When you reach specific amount of reborns your reborns being reset and you get 1 Evolution and 1 Evolution point
* When you reach specific amount of evolutions your evolutions being reset and you get 1 Nirvana and 1 Nirvana point

More reborns you need to make, more levels you need to achieve, thats also goes same for Reborns to achieve Evolution and Evoliutions to achieve Nirvana.

## Server commands

* !ul – Upgrades menu
* !guns – Reopens guns menu if closed by mistake
* !top10 – Can see top 10 players by level and xp
* !level – Can see own level and xp (edited)
