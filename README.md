## Description

Game is usually running on DE, CS maps  (E.G.:  de_dust2). Unlike other mods, this modification doesn’t have an infection mod. Thats why kill or be killed. Play as a team, on this game mode teamwork is key. Zombies get random classes with special abilities. Humans must level up in order to get better weapons  It is possible to get various upgrades from shop items but sacrificing your own weapon XP (typing command ul). When a human dies he respawns in 30-60, so humans must survive during that time, zombie respawns in a few seconds. Classes pretty much like Left4Dead, it has a tank who spawns over some time and is superior to other zombies, this is also key for zombies to win. Humans must survive until 0:00

## GunXp mod (recommended)
Humans gain XP for killing zombies, winning round. People start with Glocks or however, the server is configurated and climbs on levels that make a bit addictive server. There are ideas to expand the level system even more (like reset tiers and getting rewards for it like new zombie class)

## Flags (optional)
There is an optional flag mod, where you capture the flag and trying to protect it from another team

## Zombies

Zombie swarm has currently these classes:
* Boomer – Explodes after death, makes some damage also blinds nearby humans. It also has the ability to Vomit enemies which makes them blinded.
* Fury (Tank) – Spawns after some time, this zombie is key to victory.
* Hunter – This zombie can make really crazy jumps
* Phantom – Possibility to make himself full invisible
* Smoker – Can drag person with his tongue. Makes smoke effect after death.

## Humans

Humans level up in order to get better weapons, get better upgrades. How do they get XP? Makes damage to zombies and gets some XP.

## Prestige

The prestige system is GunXp mod expansion. When you reach levels it's over, but Prestige mod allows users to have levels reset and get some kind of bonus and continue leveling (a.k.a. grinding for that extra bonus). There a few tiers for leveling in other words:

Levels
* When you reach a certain level you get levels to reset and get 1 Reborn, 1 Reborn point, +1 to total reborns.
* When you reach a specific amount of reborns your reborns being reset and you get 1 Evolution and 1 Evolution point
* When you reach a specific amount of evolutions your evolutions being reset and you get 1 Nirvana and 1 Nirvana point

More reborns you need to make, more levels you need to achieve, that also goes the same for Reborns to achieve Evolution and Evolutions to achieve Nirvana.

## Server commands

* !ul – Upgrades menu
* !guns – Reopens guns menu if closed by mistake
* !top10 – Can see top 10 players by level and XP
* !level – Can see own level and XP
